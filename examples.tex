\section{Application Examples}

\subsection{Music Retrieval and Prediction using Sparse Distributed Memory}

A major advantage to using VMF is that it makes applications reliant on vectors much more accessible and convenient. One such example is storage and retrieval of music a sparse distributed memory \citep*{Kane88, Roge89}. A sparse distributed memory is an associative memory model proposed by Pentti Kanerva which unlike the standard random-access memory model, allows data to be retrieved using a memory address which is suffiently close to the actual storage location rather than the exact address where the data is stored. This concept gives sparse distributed memories special properties which make them resiliant to noise, errors and queries using partially complete memory addresses. Although Kanerva's original model works with address and data vectors consisting of binary bit values, improvements were made on the original model allowing an extended sparse distributed memory which works with vectors of integers for address and data vectors \citep*{Snai13}. Since VMF is primarily composed of integer vectors, this extension to the sparse distributed memory model is extremely valuable and essential for applications involving VMF.

A prototype of a music retrieval system based on a sparse distributed memory using VMF has been created. This system takes a predetermined number of notes as an input vector and tries to retrieve the piece of music which they belong to. This predetermined number of notes is referred to as the ``window size''. When this system is started, the first step that must be completed is to populate the memory with a corpus of pieces. The process of writing a piece of music to the memory is repeated for each piece in the corpus and is outlined as follows. In the writing procedure, a movable window is used to determine the memory addresses for each note. For simplicity, in this discussion, a window size of nine is used. First, the window is populated with the first nine notes of a melody and those vectors are concatenated. The result of this concatenation is the memory address where the tenth note is stored. Once the tenth note is stored, the window slides so that it begins at the second note and ends with the tenth note and these vectors are again concatenated forming the memory address of the eleventh note. More generally, the memory address for a given note is the VMF vectors for the nine preceeding notes concatenated. This procedure is repeated until the end of the piece for every piece. An illustration of this procedure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:writingToSDM}.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

In order to read music from the sparse distributed memory, the number of notes depicted by the window size must be gathered to form the memory address of the next note. In the above example, to retrieve a piece of music, the first nine notes are required to form the address of the tenth note. After retrieving the tenth note, the first note is dropped from the window and the tenth note is added to the end to create the address for the eleventh note. This procedure is repeated until the read process fails indicating that the end of the piece has been reached. The valuable part of this system is that if the user doesn't know the first nine notes of the piece and formualte an initial query vector which is noisy and contains some errors, the memory will still be able to return the next note in the piece provided that the query vector (memory address) is within a critical distance from the correct storage location. This critical distance depends on how many vectors are already stored in the memory.

In a sparse distributed memory, a finite number of hard locations exist evenly distributed throughout the address space. These hard locations are where the data is stored. When reading from a sparse distributed memory, the data contained in all hard locations within a predetermined radius called the activation radius is selected and a computation is applied on each dimension according to the state of the memory to return the data vector. An illustration of this procedure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:readingFromSDM}.

    \includegraphics[scale=.75]{resources/sdmRead.png}
    \caption{Reading from the SDM}
    \label{fig:readingFromSDM}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To test the suitability of a sparse distributed memory a test has been developed and executed to determine the accuracy of retrieval from the memory with different window and corpus sizes. For each piece of music in the corpus, the window is filled with the first n notes dictated by the window size, and the memory is read to retrieve that piece of music. The accuracy of retrieval for that piece is then calculated by comparing the original VMF file with the data retrieved from the sparse distributed memory. Finally, the overall average accuracy of retrieval is determined using the values calculated for each piece of music in the corpus. This test procedure has been repeated with varying window and corpus sizes to study how the accuracy of reading from the sparse distributed memory varies with these parameters. The results of this study are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:sdmResults}. As shown in the test results, the larger the window size, the more accurate the read operation will be. Varying the window size between four and eight notes will produce a drastic difference in accuracy, although a window size exceeding eight doesn't yield as much benefit. Using an eight note query is a resonable request for the purpose of retrieving a piece of music based on a melodic fragment, especially in standard practice western classical music. Another valuable result noticed in this study is that as the corpus size changes, the accuracy does not change nearly as much as when the window size is changed. Through the tests conducted, the system has remained scalable with the variance in corpus size, and suggests that the sparse distributed memory should be scalable beyond a corpus size of ten thousand. 

The practicality illustrated by this study for a music retrieval system is very encouraging and opens up possibilities for other applications involving VMF and sparse distributed memories.

\subsection{Piano Roll Visualization}

One method to quickly observe the general contour and structure of a piece of music is to visualize the music in a piano roll format. This is also a valuable tool for illustrating melodic contour and rhythmic composition to those who are unfamiliar with conventional music notation (an application of this type of representation is common in music and rhythm based video games). Music stored in the Vector Music Format can be easily converted to a piano roll graphical representation due to the structure of a VMF file.

\subsubsection{Visualizing VMF}

One of the key features of the Vector Music Format is that every ``tick'' has the same temporal value. Because of this feature, it is best that the x-axis (time) uses ticks in increments of one unit. For the y-axis, as in all piano roll visualizations, a horizontal division should be used for each key on the piano keyboard. The lowest pitches are placed at the bottom of the y-axis and the highest pitches are placed at the top of the y-axis. This axis configuration allows the reader to easily view rhythmic structure by reading the visualization from left to right and to easily view melodic countour by reading the visualization in the vertical sense.

Once the two axes are properly prepared, the contents of the VMF body can be plotted by iterating through the tick vectors one by one. Within each tick vector, the same process is repeated for each of the parts or voices contained within. First the attack dimension must be evaluated: if the value is 0, then there is a silence at this tick and the next tick can be evaluated. If the value is 1, then a rectangular segment is opened at the current tick position for the pitch depicted by the pitch class and octave dimensions of the vector. Finally, if the value of the attack dimension is 2, then the note is being sustained from a previous tick and the rectangular segment which was previously opened is extended. If the last vector had a value of 2 in the attack dimension and it is followed by a vector with a value of 1, the rectangular segment is closed and a new one is opened at that position to indication a new note attack. If the last vector had a value of 2 in the attack dimension and it is followed by a vector with a value of 0, the rectangular segment is simply closed and silence (empty space) follows in the current tick. This behavior can be summarized in the extended finite state machine diagram in \ref{fig:visualizationStateMachine}. A Python implementation of this procedure is available at \href{https://github.com/project-schumann/vmf-visualization}{Github} illustrating how this visualization can be easily generated with a single traversal of a VMF file by using the ruls illustrated in the finite state machine presented in \ref{fig:visualizationStateMachine}. A piano roll visualization of the last movement of J.S. Bach's BWV 108 genedated by this script is shown in \ref{fig:bwv108PianoRoll}.

\subsubsection{MIDI Visualization}

When creating a visualization directly from a MIDI file, the algorithm used depends on the type of MIDI file used. As described in ``Beyond MIDI'' \citep*{HeSe97}, there are three possible types of MIDI files; format 0, format 1, and format 2. Format 0 restricts data to a single track, format 1, allows multiple independent melodic tracks which are all synchronized to a single time line, and format 2 allows tracks which are temporally independent. When dealing with a format 0 or format 1 MIDI file, constructing the visualization is similar to visualizing a VMF file by plotting notes on the timeline by observing the note-on and note-off MIDI messages. When dealing with format 2 MIDI files, some additional work is necessary to synchronize all tracks to the same time line before plotting notes on the timeline.

\subsubsection{Humdrum Visualization}

When using a Humdrum file using the **kern format as as source for a piano roll visualization, a pre-processing step is necessary to achieve the same accuracy that VMF provides. In **kern, each pitch token is given a duration value. These duration values are equivalent to rhythmic durations seen in western music notation (ex. eighth note, sixteenth note, ...). To build the time axis of a piano roll visualization and plot notes, the largest common denominator of all the duration values to display must be determined to be used as the basic time unit. For example, if the music in \ref{fig:voicesExample} was encoded as a **kern Humdrum file, a pre-processing stage is required to determine that the eighth note is the greatest common denominator of all duration values in the piece to be visualized. Once this unit is determined, notes can be plotted by calculating how many duration units is necessary to represent each note's length accurately. In the case of the music in \ref{fig:voicesExample}, an eighth note requires one unit, a quarter note requires two units, and a half note requires four units.

By following this procedure, a **kern Humdrum file can be visualized, but the pre-processing step adds extra complexity which is not present when using a VMF file as a source.

\subsubsection{MusicXML Visualization}

Like VMF and MIDI, MusicXML encodes duration using a ``tick'' system where note durations are described in terms of subdivisions of a quarter note. In the simplest of cases, this lends itself well to piano roll visualization as in the case of VMF, however, MusicXML has some differences in this system which can cause complications when constructing a visualization of this nature. In polyphonic music, MusicXML allows different parts to use a ticks of a different value to describe note duration. For example, it is acceptable for one part to have a tick value of one third of a quarter note and another part to have a tick value of one half of a quarter note. In a case like this, it would be necessary to convert all parts to use a common tick value to facilitate visualization. Finally, MusicXML also allows the value of a tick to change in the middle of a part. Like the last case, the entire part would have to be converted to use a common tick value for the same reasons.

With any of the described formats, piano roll visualization is possible, but in some cases, varying degrees of pre-processing is necessary before the visualization can be constructed. VMF provides an advantage over these other formats as no pre-processing or computation is necessary to construct the visualization.
